This game runs in the windows command terminal

How to play:
Choose how many players (1-4).
The player(s) will take turns to find as many words as they can from the game grid in 3 minutes.

Once you are ready, follow the prompt (enter 'y') to begin.

enter a valid word (as found in Collin's dictionary) that can be made up of adjacent letters on the grid.
Letters can be horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent. Each letter can be used only once per word.

The letter 'Q' on the grid represents two letters 'QU' players should type both letters for any word containing 'Qu'.

Minimum word length is 3 letters. 
The longer your word, the higher it scores!
Word values
1-2 letters: 0 points
3-4 letters: 1 point
5 letters: 2 points
6 letters: 3 points
7 letters: 5 points
8 letters or more: 11 points

Shortcuts:
To end a player's turn (if you can't find any more letters within the time limit), enter '0'.
To reprint the grid (if it scrolls out of view) enter '1'.

After all players have completed their turn, the round scores will be displayed.
(The current version doesn't deduct points when more than one player has the same word, this will be corrected in future updates)

to play another round, enter 'y' to 'shake again', or quit to display total scores and the winner.

Thanks for playing!
